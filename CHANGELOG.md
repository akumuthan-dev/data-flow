# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## 2020-09-15

### Changed
- Use postgres's native `copy_from` rather than `DataFrame.to_sql` to load data in postgres for the "fast polling" pipelines for significant speed gains (~15x).

## 2020-09-14

### Added

- Contact and advisor last interaction pipelines.

### Changed
- ONS UK trade in services migrated to new polling pipeline.
