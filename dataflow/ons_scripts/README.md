# ONS Scripts - Important Reading

This directory contains a collection of scripts from https://github.com/GSS-Cogs/family-trade which are written by/on behalf of ONS (i.e. not DIT) and power the [gss-data](http://gss-data.org.uk/).

We've had problems using their sparql API directly and so are **temporarily** going to run some of these ourselves. These are not intended to be long-lasting and we should absolutely favour going back to an ONS API as the long-term source of truth for any data we want to use from them.

Scripts are copied from the repo above, with a permalink to the commit that they came from, and then modified in a separate commit as necessary to clearly identify the changes we are making.
